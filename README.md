# react-vr-app

This is a team hack-night project that we played with at a [Real World React Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Real-World-React/events/242620292/) on 2017-08-24.

This is a mashup of two goals:
1. Learn [React VR](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/index.html). Thanks @ryapapap for the idea!
2. Figure out a hack-night project.

We had 2 hours - so we chose to wrap a simple server API - a memory based CRUD key-value API. [go-linker-express](https://github.com/jazeee/go-linker-express).

## Install and Run
1. Install and start [go-linker-express](https://github.com/jazeee/go-linker-express).
2. In this directory, `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Wait a few minutes
5. Open [localhost](http://localhost:8081/vr/index.html?hotreload)
6. Enjoy!

## Further way
1. Learn more of [React VR on Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/build-virtual-reality-experiences-using-react-vr).
2. Build next badass project
